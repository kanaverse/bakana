/**
 * Save the analysis results into an [**ArtifactDB** representation](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas) of a SingleCellExperiment.
 * This uses a language-agnostic format mostly based on HDF5 and JSON, which can be read into a variety of frameworks like R and Python.
 * The aim is to facilitate downstream analysis procedures that are not supported by **bakana** itself; 
 * for example, a bench scientist can do a first pass with **kana** before passing the results to a computational collaborator for deeper inspection.
 *
 * @param {object} state - Existing analysis state containing results, after one or more runs of {@linkcode runAnalysis}.
 * @param {string} name - Name of the SingleCellExperiment to be saved.
 * @param {object} [options={}] - Optional parameters.
 * @param {boolean} [options.reportOneIndex=false] - Whether to report 1-based indices, for use in 1-based languages like R.
 * Currently, this only refers to the column indices of the custom selections reported in the SingleCellExperiment's metadata.
 * @param {boolean} [options.storeModalityColumnData=false] - Whether to store modality-specific per-cell statistics (e.g., QC metrics, size factors) in the column data of the associated alternative Experiment.
 * This can yield a cleaner SingleCellExperiment as statistics are assigned to the relevant modalities.
 * That said, the default is still `false` as many applications (including **bakana** itself, via the {@linkcode AbstractArtifactdbDataset} and friends) will not parse the column data of alternative Experiments. 
 * In such cases, all modality-specific metrics are stored in the main experiment's column data with a modality-specific name, e.g., `kana::ADT::quality_control::sums`.
 * @param {boolean} [options.forceBuffer=true] - Whether to force all files to be loaded into memory as Uint8Array buffers.
 * @param {?string} [options.directory=null] - Project directory in which to save the file components of the SingleCellExperiment.
 * Only used for Node.js; if supplied, it overrides any setting of `forceBuffer`.
 *
 * @return {Array} Array of objects where each object corresponds to a file in the SingleCellExperiment's representation.
 * Each inner object contains `metadata`, another object containing the metadata for the corresponding file.
 *
 * For files that are not purely metadata, the inner object will also contain  `contents`, the contents of the file.
 * The type of `contents` depends on the context and optional parameters.
 *
 * - If `forceBuffer = true`, `contents` is a Uint8Array of the file contents.
 *   This is probably the most advisable setting for browser environments.
 * - If `forceBuffer = false`, `contents` may be either a Uint8Array or a string to a temporary file path. 
 *   In a browser context, the temporary path is located on the **scran.js** virtual file system,
 *   see [here](https://kanaverse.github.io/scran.js/global.html#readFile) to extract its contents and to clean up afterwards.
 * - If the function is called from Node.js and `directory` is supplied, `contents` is a string to a file path inside `directory`.
 *   This overrides any expectations from the setting of `forceBuffer` and is the most efficient approach for Node.js.
 * 
 * The SingleCellExperiment itself will be accessible from a top-level object at the path defined by `name`.
